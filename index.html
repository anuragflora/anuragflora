        <div class="acount__container container grid">
          <div class="about__data">
            <h3 class="about__description">Importance of the Book:</h3>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">Education has become a determining factor for everyone to scale up the ladder of success. Therefore everyone has an inherent desire to do well or rather excel in studies. Students involved with studies as well as their parents, teachers and other well-wishers will want a student to excel in studies. However, only a few students excel in studies, whereas the majority perform average or even poor. Elders and peers can motivate a student and the teachers can teach the subject content. Still, the mechanics of "How to study" is the gap that most students cannot bridge. The students who understand this mechanics of how to study are the ones who constantly excel in studies. This book will bring out the finer details about the mechanics of "How to Study". The systematic method to excel in studies advocated in this book will cover all the aspects right from the beginning when the student gets to know that he is affected for a course until the final day of the final examinations.</p>
            <h3 class="about__description">Who you should buy this book?</h3>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">This book will be immensely valuable for students with a basic developed understanding capability, i.e. the age group starting twelve years of age. It will serve well even the students enrolling for professional courses or even competitive examinations. The parents of young students who want their kids to excel in studies will also be hugely benefitted from this book. Apart from them, the teachers at various academic institutions would also find this book insightful and quite helpful in training their students in the art of systematic learning methodologies.  Educational establishments like schools and colleges, training establishments like coaching institutes and even specialization training establishments would also benefit from this book. Suppose the true potential of this book is realized. In that case, this book has the potential to be included in the course curriculum of high school in various national and state educational boards as well. </p>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify>Several books exist on various online selling platforms, indulging with genre of student motivation and practical study tips. Most of these books address the students attempting specific competitive examinations and guide students in their preparations. There are other books that deal with motivation, realization of true potential and positive thinking. There are only a few authors who have attempted to simplify the complex mechanics of studies.</p>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">This book deals with the practical aspects that the student will encounter during studies. It provides a holistic approach right from the beginning when the student becomes aware of a forthcoming academic journey and provides guidance right until the final stages of final examinations. The major focus is towards planning and preparations for various activities which the student will have to indulge in during his academic journey. Time management and the need for goal-oriented effort in every study session have been deliberated upon to utilize time and effort efficiently. This book advocates smart hard work using associative learning instead of rudimentary rote learning.</p>
            <h3 class="about__description">Guidance to do well!</h3>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">Elders tell the students that they should work hard in studies to do well in life and the teachers, on the other hand, guide a student in the subject matter. However, nobody guides the student about how to do well in studies. Perhaps the difference between the students who do well in studies and the average performers is this gap of understanding about mechanics of doing well in studies. The students who lack this knowledge are not able to organize their studies efficiently. They don't plan their studies and as a result, end up performing inadequately despite their hard work. They suffer from anxiety and stress and with time, lose their motivation to do well in studies.</p>
            <h3 class="about__description">Derivatives from the book:</h3>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">It gives an insight into efficient organizing of studies for achieving desired results.	 It starts with collecting and collating the study material at the beginning of the course and taking necessary inputs from others, giving a fair idea about the course. The student is told about the importance and method of setting up a study space to enable maximum output from his study efforts. The aspect of time management is dealt with deliberately. The entire course duration is divided into various stages to enable a systematic learning and revision process with the application of various study techniques. Time management during each study session is also discussed to enable maximum learning. </p>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">The book discusses in detail the preparation required of a student towards preparation for classroom lectures and the mechanics of learning during classroom lectures. The aspect of notes taking is dealt with in great detail to enable stress-free notes taking, enhancing the student's gains from his revision sessions. The aspect of peer learning is discussed, which would enable the student to learn the concepts well and will also facilitate the creation of the question banks to help during the test preparations. The aspect of learning, studying and revising is dealt with in detail to acquaint the student with the correct and efficient mechanics of these activities to enable them to derive maximum benefits from their efforts.</p>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">It aims to help the students achieve economy of effort in their studies so that their energy and time are focused on the activities that positively impact their results. Various measures to be taken by the students to help in maximizing the returns from their academic efforts have been brought out deliberately. The students are also exposed to various preparations other than the academic ones, which are often neglected but are of paramount importance for enhancing the gains from academic preparations. This book will introduce the student to the aspect of detailed planning and focused execution of tasks to achieve desired goals. It also reduces stress levels and improves students' motivation levels through regular, time-bound and achievable goals. It has the potential to prepare the students of today to be effective and efficient professionals of tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="about__description" style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the book ends with a discussion on improving one's performance in all the domains of life. It emphasizes the development of core values to build a person's character and enable him to achieve meaningful success in life.</p>
